Feel free to visit her tutorials, they are amazing!


### Description
As I have started working as a QA Manual Tester, I am trying to learn more about unit/integration testing, and so, I wanted to follow a tutorial app like this one, just to remind myself how to work with Vue. I have some plans where I would like to use Vue and Electron in the future for personal use, but also I want to make practice tools for myself for testing.
